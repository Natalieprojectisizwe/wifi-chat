setup:
------
once checked out run:

```npm start```

...which will install dependencies and start a server on port 3000

Then visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

__Note:__ Those familiar with nodejs may want to just run `node index` to start the server each time rather than have the system run `npm i .` with each `npm start` call.
